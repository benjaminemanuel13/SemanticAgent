** Semantic Kernel Agents Project **

Just a simple project to show how Agents can work in Semantic Kernel.

The web site is not implemented but could be the backend of the console app if you wanted to call the Api's from "Ask" method in the Agent.

Only one Agent is implemented but it shows a very simple call made, could be integrated with any Api you want really.

Any suggestions please contact me at benjaminemanuel13@gmail.com

** UPDATE **

Have added another Agent, a Human Resources Agent that looks up staff details using one plugin and simulates sending email using retrieved email address:

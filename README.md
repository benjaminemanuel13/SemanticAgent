** Semantic Kernel Agents Project **

Just a simple project to show how Agents can work in Semantic Kernel.

The web site is not implemented but could be the backend of the console app if you wanted to call the Api's from "Ask" method in the Agent.

Two Agents are implemented and it shows where a very simple call can be made and be integrated with any Api you wanted really.

Any suggestions please contact me at benjaminemanuel13@gmail.com

** UPDATE **

Have added another Agent, a Human Resources Agent that looks up staff details using one plugin and simulates sending email using retrieved email address using another plugin:


Prompt I gave:

** UPDATE **

Have added PesistentAgent with Function Calling capability though I think Semantic Kernel style Agents with plugins is better.
